Theoretical model is the textual representation of a software: what it does, why and in some cases how. It should be detailed enough that an AI can replicate a whole software following this and easy enough so that a new recruit can understand.

## Human Only
- Only humans write the model. AI may read it, but must never create, edit, move or delete anything in it.
- The model is the source of truth. When the code disagrees with the model, the code changes.
- If the model is unclear or contradicts itself, AI asks a question in the compile report. It never guesses, and never suggests new wording.

## Doctrine
- Use AI for ideation but always **write by hand.** The words should be yours.
- **Make important statements crude**. "A refund is reject after 30 days", not 'refunds are handled carefully'
- **One claim per sentence.** A failed compile can then point at exactly one claim.
- **Use firm words.** *Must*, *never* and *always* for rules, *may* for options. Avoid *should* and *usually*.
- **Say why.** A rule without a reason gets "improved" away.
- **Say what the system must not do.** Behaviour the model doesn't describe shouldn't exist in the code.
- **Keep headings stable and give rules IDs** (`INV-3`, `AC-7`). Failure pointers anchor to them. Retire an ID; never reuse it.
- **Mark what isn't built yet**.
- **Answer Claude's questions in the model**, not in chat.
- **One intent per commit**, and the commit message says why.
